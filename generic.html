						<p>These are some of the photoshop projects that I have done.

					<img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt=" width:"300"; height="300" " /></a>
					<p>This picture was from an assignment called extraction. in this photo I extracted a polar bear and a picture of myself and pasted it onto a winter themed background. This is my favorite picture that I have done.</p>
					<img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="width:"300"; height="300" ">
					<p>This is a picture that I photoshopped that was inspired by one of the famouse art pieces of Andy Warhol. I really like the colors that I used in this photo.</p>
					<img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="width:"300"; height="300" ">
					<p>This assignment that I did is called back to history. In this assignment we used the history tool on photoshop to add color texture to the picture. </p>
					
					<img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="width:"300"; height="300" ">
					<p>This assignment was to work on colorizing. The original photo was black and white and we had to use differnt tools and techniques to bring color back to the image.</p>
					<img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="width:"300"; height="300" ">
					<p>I edited this pic of Brad Pitt by using the liquified effect.  </p>
					
					<img src="images/pic15.jpg" alt="width:"300"; height="300" ">
					<p>This is the photo that I edited for the final of last semester.This piece was edited to mock the original image to show the real truth about what the advertisment is trying to say.   </p>
					
					<img src="images/gif.gif" alt="width:"300"; height="300" ">
					<p>This is an animated gif of a girl running that I made from a 12 picture sprite sheet.The one this that I did not like about making this would be how time consuming this was. </p>

					<img src="images/original.gif"  alt="width:"300"; height="300" ">
					<p>This is an original gif that I made from using timeline on Photoshop. To me this was very simple because all I had to do was draw a few images on different layers and move it around when forming the timeline for the images to move. I got this idea for my gif because I really like cats and I wanted to make it have a Mario theme where the character is jumping over certain objects to get to the prize.  	</p>
					
					<img src="imgaes/gif 1.gif" alt="width:"300"; height="400" ">
					<p>This is a gif I made using photohop. I took this picture on my trip to yosemite and I really liked how the clouds looked in this photo. It makes me think of Zeus and how he would live in the clouds. </p>
